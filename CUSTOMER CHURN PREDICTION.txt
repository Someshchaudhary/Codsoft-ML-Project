# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
The **Customer Churn Prediction** project aims to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using machine learning techniques. This project leverages Python-based libraries and provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide to loading data, preprocessing it, training models, and evaluating their performance.

The goal is to enable businesses to proactively identify customers at risk of leaving and take actions to retain them, enhancing customer satisfaction and business revenue.

## Features
- Data exploration and visualization to understand customer behavior.
- Preprocessing steps like scaling, encoding, and splitting the data.
- Application of multiple machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure performance.

## Structure
The Jupyter Notebook includes the following sections:
1. **Introduction**: Explains the problem and the dataset.
2. **Data Loading**: Imports the dataset and explores its structure.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes trends and relationships.
4. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the data for modeling.
5. **Model Training**: Builds and trains machine learning models.
6. **Evaluation**: Compares models using performance metrics.
7. **Conclusions**: Summarizes insights and recommendations.

## Requirements
The project requires Python 3 and the following libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

These can be installed using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook customer_churn_prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to explore and analyze the dataset.

## Dataset
